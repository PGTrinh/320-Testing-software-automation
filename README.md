**Question: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
<br>
Making sure my code or software works correctly and is safe is super important. To do that, I'll run tests on it, like checking if different parts work together as they should. I'll also ask others to look at my code and find any mistakes or things that could make it unsafe. I'll make sure I'm using good coding practices, so I don't accidentally leave any bug that could be exploit. Also, I'll keep updating everything regularly to stay on top of any new problems that might come up.

**Question: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
<br>
Understanding what users want and putting that into my program is a bit like doing a group project. I'll need to talk to the the users who will be using my software and ask them lots of questions to figure out what they really need it to do, what features are important to them. Then I'll write down all those things in a list and start working on them one by one. I might also draw pictures of what the software will look like, so I can show it to my classmates and see if they like it and if it's easy to use. If they tell me something's not right, I'll go back and change it until it's better.

**Question: How do I approach designing software?**
<br>
When it comes to designing software, I'll start by writing down all the things I need it to do. For example, if it's a game, I'll list out the levels, characters, and how they'll move. Then, I'll think about how these pieces fit together and draw boxes and lines to show how they connect. This helps me understand the big picture. I'll also think about how it should look when someone uses it, like where buttons should go and how the colors should be. I'll colleagues for their opinions and try to make sure it's easier to use. Once I have everything planned out, I'll start writing the actual code and testing each unit as well as the final product to make sure everything work well before launching the software.
